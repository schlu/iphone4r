iBug
=======
This portion of the plugin is to debug iPhone and iPod Touch web applications.  Based Heavily on the amazing work of the amazing Joe Hewitt (http://joehewitt.com)

Currently, this is a near direct port of:
http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/firebug_for_iph.php

The reason I did this is to get around XSS issues I was having.

Copy this to head of your iPhone web page <head> tag:
<%= include_ibug %>

Instead of running ./script/console, run ./script/ibug, I hope this is only temporary.  Your site will function exactly as if it were running under script/console except there will be some special urls to handle debugging commands sent to and from the iPhone.

Then point your browser at the server created by ./script/ibug, with a path of "/ibug/firebug.html" (example: http://localhost:3000/ibug/firebug.html)

At this point you can treat your browser like firebug (lite) on the iphone. And you can call console.log on your iPhone and the messages will show up on your browser window (pretty cool).

This is has only been tested in firefox on mac leopard, I am eager to hear your feedback.  If you have any concerns, comments, questions or suggestions, email me at schlueter + at + gmail + . + com.

Link Helpers
===========
Used to link to the native phone applications like YouTube, Gmaps, or Phone Dialer

These methods are:
link_to_map(text, q_value)

link_to_you_tube(text, video_id)

link_to_phone(number, options = {})

These will work in or outside if iUi provided you use the modified version of iUi included in this plugin
